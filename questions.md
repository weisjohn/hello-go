# questions I have

### primitives

 - If `int` exists, as well as `int8`, etc, what is the size of `int`?

from: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types
> uint     either 32 or 64 bits

> int      same size as uint


 - Why is there an `int` and various levels of precision, yet there is no `float` but only `float32` and `float64`?



### for Steven

 - do you find yourself actually using "naked returns"?
 - what were some of your biggest "a ha" moments?
 - what tools other than the go command do you use?
